Problem description:

                                  Increasing Sequence
 - time limit per test: 1 second
 - memory limit per test: 64 megabytes
 - input: standard input
 - output: standard output
 
A sequence a0, a1, ..., at - 1 is called increasing 
if ai - 1 < ai for each i: 0 < i < t.

You are given a sequence b0, b1, ..., bn - 1 and a 
positive integer d. In each move you may choose 
one element of the given sequence and add d to it. 
What is the least number of moves required to make 
the given sequence increasing?

 - Input: 
The first line of the input contains two integer numbers 
n and d (2 ≤ n ≤ 2000, 1 ≤ d ≤ 106). The second line 
contains space separated sequence b0, b1, ..., bn - 1 
(1 ≤ bi ≤ 106).

 - Output: 
Output the minimal number of moves needed to make the 
sequence increasing.

- Examples: 
input: 
4 2
1 3 3 2

output: 
3
